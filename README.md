# requestasong

A simple music request system, built with PHP and MYSQL.

Class based system to expose data, returned in JSON format for further integration.

Database not included, but table structure available for CREATE purposes (see tables directory for SQL files)

Latest version of jQuery included in repo. For the latest version, please go to http://jquery.com/

No real styling used here. I just wanted to see if this was possible (and mess around with some Jquery/JS at the same time)

(To get a basic version working, I grabbed song/artist info from iTunes)
