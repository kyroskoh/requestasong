#requestasong

A simple music request system, built with PHP and MYSQL.

Class based system to expose data, returned in JSON format for further integration.

You have 2 versions:

index.php allows you to click on artist names to see what songs are available on the system

index2.php allows you to type in the name of the artist/song to then filter everything else out.

Database not included, but table structure available for CREATE purposes (see tables directory for SQL files)

Latest version of jQuery included in repo. For the latest version, please go to http://jquery.com/

No real styling used here. I just wanted to see if this was possible (and mess around with some Jquery/JS at the same time)

(To get a basic version working, I grabbed song/artist info from iTunes, and then split out artist/track information)
